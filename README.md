+ Hello, my name is Yunus Emre Da≈ütan.
+ I am currently studying on Software Engineering at Uskudar University.
+ I mostly spend my hours on PC and generally code or play games.
+ I am focused on creating programs by creative ideas and developing games by using popular game engines.
+ This is my youtube channel that includes some gaming and coding videos : https://www.youtube.com/c/DarkPK
+ I am using high-tech devices for a very long time, probably since I am 5 years old. I learned coding for the first time at 9 years old. One of my friends who is 4 years older than
me teached HTML to me. Of course I did not learn it but I understood the very basic concepts to make a very basic website. That was pretty stunning in that ages. Anyways, after
that I really loved developing works and also cyber security but there was something that I thought I could not change. My family wanted me to become Doctor when I grow up, that
was not my actualy goal but I felt like it was. When I almost finished High School (in the last year) I thought on it very much and finally understood that it was not my actual
goal. I really wanted to be a Software Engineer because that was what I enjoy doing. It seemed the best option and my lifegoal for me and then I chose this job. Now, I am really
glad that I have made that decision and my family also supports me because I enjoy my job, my studying. They were not looking good on me choosing my own dream job at first but
after I told them how I love it they accepted my job idea. Now here I am, learning something new everyday. I hope after I finish university, with that I have learned I'll be able
to do most of the things that I dreamed to develop.
+ I am uploading my programs and games to Github for you to test, see and inspire.
+ I hope I'll get better at what I do by living in this platform with this community.
